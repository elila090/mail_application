### **Mail application**

**HOW TO USE**
Make sure to have a secret.py file containing two email addresses (from and to the email will be sent) as well as the 
password, keywords of your choice and web sites of which the program will be looking at.

Redis is the chosen database which must be installed and have its server running (redis-server.exe) when running the mail application.



**FUTURE WORK**

_This program, atm, does not scrape each hour, it just scrapes when its running and sends the email immediately. This 
may be changed in the future._
